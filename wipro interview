1. Strings and Arrays
Key Concepts to Review:

String manipulation: reversing a string, finding substrings, replacing characters.

Array operations: traversing, sorting, searching, merging.

Common problems: Palindrome, anagrams, finding duplicates in an array, etc.

Practice Problems:

Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.

Implement a function to find the maximum sum subarray.

Write a function to remove duplicates from a sorted array.

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Key Concepts to Review:

Classes and Objects: understand how to define and instantiate them.

Inheritance: know how to use base and derived classes.

Polymorphism: method overloading and overriding.

Encapsulation and Abstraction: understand access modifiers and abstract classes/interfaces.

Practice Problems:

Create a simple class to represent a Book with properties like title, author, and ISBN.

Implement a class hierarchy to represent different types of employees (e.g., Full-time, Part-time, Intern).

Design a class for a Bank Account with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and checking the balance.
